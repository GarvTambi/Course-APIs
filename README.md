# Course-APIs
#### Build a scalable serverless RESTful API that performs Create and Read operations for a "Course" entity. 


###### To design and build a scalable serverless RESTful API using AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, and AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) for the "Course" entity with Create and Read operations, follow these steps:

### WorkFlow

##### Set up the development environment:

Install Rust on your machine by following the instructions at https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.
Install the AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) and configure it with your AWS credentials.
Create a new Rust project:

##### Open a terminal and navigate to your desired project directory.
Run the command cargo new course-api to create a new Rust project named "course-api".
Change into the project directory with cd course-api.
Add dependencies to your project:

##### Open the Cargo.toml file in your project directory.
Add the necessary dependencies for AWS Lambda and DynamoDB:

##### Implement the API handlers:

Create a new file called main.rs in the src directory.
Inside main.rs, define the necessary structs for the "Course" entity and import the required dependencies.
Implement the handlers for the Create and Read operations by defining functions that handle the corresponding HTTP methods.
Within the handlers, use the rusoto_dynamodb crate to interact with DynamoDB to perform the desired operations on the "Course" entity.
##### Use AWS CDK to provision the infrastructure:

Install AWS CDK by following the instructions at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_install.
Initialize a new CDK project by running cdk init --language=typescript.
Write the CDK code in TypeScript to define the infrastructure stack, including AWS Lambda and DynamoDB resources. You can use the AWS CDK constructs for Lambda (@aws-cdk/aws-lambda) and DynamoDB (@aws-cdk/aws-dynamodb) to create the necessary resources.
Define the necessary environment variables, permissions, and configurations for the Lambda function and DynamoDB table.
Deploy the CDK stack using cdk deploy.
##### Test the API:

Once the CDK stack is deployed, you'll receive the API endpoint URL.
Use tools like cURL, Postman, or any other HTTP client to test the API by sending requests to the provided endpoint URL.
Send a POST request to the appropriate endpoint with the required data in the request body to create a new course.
Send GET requests to the appropriate endpoints to retrieve course information by ID or category.
##### Additional considerations:

Implement input validation and error handling in your handlers to ensure data integrity and provide meaningful error responses.
Consider using a library like uuid to generate unique course IDs.
Utilize appropriate logging libraries to capture logs and errors for analysis.
Implement pagination and filtering options for the Read operation if necessary.
By following these steps, you can design and build a scalable serverless RESTful API for creating and reading courses using AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, and AWS CDK.
